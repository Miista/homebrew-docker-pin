// receiver stands in for ntfy: it accepts duva's notifications and records

// A container like everything else in a scenario, rather than a server in the

// receiver on the host would be reachable only through a gateway address that
// nothing in production uses -- and the fixture could not simply declare it
// as a service.
//
// It exists because the unit tests fake the notifier, so what they cannot
// show is whether a notification fired at all, fired once rather than every
// run, and named the right thing. That needs something on the other end of
// the request.
